# TODO:
# 1. Move the robot in a given number of steps forward, backward, left and right
# 2. Add a color sensor and make it follow a line
# 3. accompolish a small part of the 1st mission (TBD)

# This program requires LEGO EV3 MicroPython v2.0 or higher.
# Click "Open user guide" on the EV3 extension tab for more information.

# Create your objects here.

    if dir is "left":
        robot.turn(steps)
    else:
        robot.turn(-1 * steps)

# Notes:
# robot.straight(300), use ruler to measure the distance in cm and then multiply by 10 to get mm
# robot.turn(90) = makes robot turn right/left (no need to add degrees)
# Since robot is built backwards, makes robot.straight codes to go negatively and vise versa for moving robot backwards 
# Make robot.turn code negative for moving right and postive for left 

# What did we accomplish
# 1. github setup to share code and for version control
# 2. succefully checked in the code into github from visual studio
# 3. Refactored the code to make it more readable and usable
# 4. We came up a plan to complete the mission

# Next steps
# 1. Find out the mission to solve?
# 2. Try this program on the lego and make sure it works
# 3. Write the code to solve small part of the big mission

# Write your program here.
