# we can make new changes

# Notes:
# robot.straight(300), use ruler to measure the distance in cm and then multiply by 10 to get mm
# robot.turn(90) = makes robot turn right/left (no need to add degrees)
# Since robot is built backwards, makes robot.straight codes to go negatively and vise versa for moving robot backwards 
# Make robot.turn code negative for moving right and postive for left 

# Write your program here.
